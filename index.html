<p>1. If you're good at something, never do it for free.

2.I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.

3.Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of Chaos.

4.This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

5.Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push.

6.Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger.

7.Why so SERIOUS..?</p>
